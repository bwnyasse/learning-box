## Prioritization Framework

### Priority Matrix (Impact vs. Effort)

**High Impact, Low Effort (Do First)**
- Basic Wireless Health Dashboard
- Rogue AP Detection Dashboard

**High Impact, High Effort (Plan For)**
- Advanced Wireless Anomaly Detection
- Cross-Source Security Intelligence
- Automated Remediation Workflows

**Lower Impact, Low Effort (Quick Wins)**
- AP Inventory & Status Monitoring
- Simple Security Event Viewer
- Client Connection Statistics

**Lower Impact, High Effort (Consider Later)**
- Predictive Capacity Planning
- Location-Based Analytics

### Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Basic Wireless Health Dashboard** - Start here for immediate visibility with minimal effort
2. **Rogue AP Detection Dashboard** - Quick security win with existing data
3. **AP Inventory & Status Monitoring** - Complete the operational visibility trifecta
4. **Simple Security Event Viewer** - Add basic security context
5. **Client Connection Statistics** - Round out the simple dashboards

Then plan for more complex implementations:

6. **Automated Remediation Workflows** - First step into automation
7. **Cross-Source Security Intelligence** - Begin more sophisticated security analysis
8. **Advanced Wireless Anomaly Detection** - Implement ML-based proactive monitoring
9. **Predictive Capacity Planning** - Leverage historical data for forecasting
10. **Location-Based Analytics** - Add spatial context if still valuable

This approach gives you immediate value with simple REST calls while building toward more sophisticated capabilities as resources permit.
