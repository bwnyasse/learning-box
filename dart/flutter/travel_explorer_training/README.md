A hands-on workshop building a complete travel application that incorporates all the advanced Flutter concepts requested, with special emphasis on architecture, interactive maps, and custom widgets.

### App Features (Mapped to Training Requirements)

1. **Interactive Map Screen**
   - Display locations on a map (Interactive Maps)
   - Custom markers for different types of locations (Markers)
   - Route drawing between points (Polylines)
   - Map interactions (zooming, panning)
   - Advanced cartography features (custom styling, clustering)

2. **Location Details Screen**
   - Custom UI with advanced widgets (CustomPainter, BoxDecoration)
   - Animated transitions between data (Animations)
   - Rating/review system with animations (Tween, AnimationController)
   - Photo gallery with camera integration (Mobile Integration)

3. **User Profile**
   - Firebase authentication (Firebase)
   - Saving favorite locations (Firebase Database)
   - User preferences with internationalization (i18n)
   - Cross-platform UI adaptations

4. **Trip Planner**
   - Enhanced state management with BLOC for complex planning logic
   - Real-time updates using Firebase and Streams
   - Custom UI elements with RotatedBox and Opacity
   - Performance optimization strategies

5. **Custom Package Integration**
   - Creating a travel-specific widget package
   - Package structure and testing
   - Local implementation in main app

### Architecture and Tooling Improvements

1. **Flutter Modular Integration**
   - Modular project structure using flutter_modular
   - Route management with nested navigation
   - Dependency injection for cleaner code
   - Module isolation and lazy loading

2. **Flutter Version Management (FVM)**
   - Setting up FVM for version control
   - Managing multiple Flutter versions
   - Creating project-specific configurations
   - Integration with CI/CD pipelines

### Workshop Structure (Step-by-Step Git Branches)

1. **step-0-setup**: Project initialization with FVM and flutter_modular
2. **step-1-architecture**: Setting up modular architecture and routes
3. **step-2-maps**: Implementing the interactive map with advanced cartography
4. **step-3-custom-widgets**: Adding custom UI elements and widgets
5. **step-4-animations**: Implementing animations and transitions
6. **step-5-package**: Creating and integrating a custom package
7. **step-6-firebase**: Adding Firebase integration with security best practices
8. **step-7-mobile**: Implementing device features (camera, permissions)
9. **step-8-state**: Advanced BLOC pattern for state management
10. **step-9-devtools**: Debugging and performance monitoring
11. **step-10-complete**: Final project with all features implemented
